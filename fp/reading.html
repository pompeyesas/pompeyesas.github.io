        <h1>How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</h1>
        <p>
            The reading “Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully” was really eye opening in the way I’ll think about what a website is in the future. The way Laurel Schwulst broke down the different ways a website can be interpreted and built upon ranging from being a “shelf” to a “garden” and even a “rock that was thrown deep into the ocean” introduced a new way to think about the web and everything that surrounds it. Édouard U. also had a very interesting take on what he perceived to be conceptual isolation.

    <h2>Post-Digital-Print</h2>
    <p>The selections from “Publishing from Post-Digital-Print” were really interesting in the way that the topic of print in our heavily digitized age. I liked Alessandro Ludovico’s quick line about how the medium of print is so ingrained in our current society that trying to change or replace it with E-publishing will be an incredibly difficult task compared to other physical things that have found a way to be completely replaced by a digital alternative. Opening up the conversation about how different mediums of art and creation and how such things may slowly disappear in our current age induces many conflicting feelings within myself.</p>
    <h3>STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living</h3>
    <p>The text “STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities” was an enjoyable read and definitely allowed me to make clear connections to how the web serves its users today. The text demonstrates the contrast between the more diverse and personalized version of the web back in the 90s-2000s to how corporate driven and centralized it is now. The existence of Geocities lead to plenty of people conceptualizing what a webpage even was but it also gave them freedoms for whatever they wanted to present. </p>
    <h2>Dispersion</h2>
    <p>The text “Dispersion” by Seth Price creates a space for a conversation about how art works now have become so infinitely shareable and copyable that peoples view of who owns what has become very nuanced. I completely agree in the sense that people are always arguing in the online art community about who created what idea or who is reposting a drawing without permission and if thats a problem. Im fully of the belief that nothing of present is original or hasn't been done before in some fashion. </p>
    <h1>Alt-Text as Poetry</h1>
    <p>The Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook is extremely interesting in how certain phrases and terms and how there are little things that differentiate them. For example, people (and the workbook) have been using the terms “Alt-text” and “Image Descriptions”  interchangeably even though the relationship follows the same one between squares and rectangles. All Alt-Text are image descriptions however not all image description are Alt-text.</p>
    <h2>New Modernism(s)
    </h2>
    <p>New modernisms was an interesting read and actually brought some new historical facts to the table that I was unaware of. The most interesting section to me was the one that focused on how Disney’s Mickey Mouse played a role in the resistance of Nazis. Not only that but the shapes used for the character itself was extremely similar to that of Bauhaus’ shift to commercial production.</p>
    <h3>A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures</h3>
    <p>The text “A personal computer for children of all cultures” brought up some realities of the world that I have had the privilege of never even thinking of before. For example, the existence of bias towards the English language and its layout. Whether this manifests in the physical world or the world of coding languages.</p>
    <h2>Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</h2>
    <p>The text “Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games” by Dot Tuer to be a new look in how preforming concept can manifest itself. They said that during the process of building familiarity with the string game they had everyone develop a mastery of the string figures but without mastering a sequence. This was because their goal was to explore a set of possibilities not to create or perform a routine. I think that the inclusion of preparing a set based on their nine components was also interesting. </p>
    <h1>Performing the Feed</h1>
    <p>The text “Performing the Feed” was interesting in how it broke down the process of participating in the web and social media through the lens of a step by step approach. Going from the act of posting, which was interpreted in many ways from posting on social media or even posting a notice on another persons door, to the interpretation of these many things that are being added to the feed.</p>
    <h2>Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think</h2>
    <p>The text "Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think" by Hito Steyerl is interesting in its take on how muddied reality can get with video games and art in the way of how we begin to distance ourselves from things in the contemporary world. They also bring up the idea of what creative labor is and how it plays a role in todays economy. Things such as the hate towards video games due to a sub section of people viewing them as nothing but a capitalists tool to weaken and profit from the masses. </p>
